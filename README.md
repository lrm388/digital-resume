#Biography

My name is Lindsay Moore and I was born and raised in Katy, Texas, but I am currently a senior attending Mississippi State University.
I am majoring in electrical engineering and pursuing a minor in mathematics. I am a member of the Mississippi State Women's Club Soccer Team, 
and enjoy playing soccer and going to the gym in my free time. I enjoy being outdoors and some of my favorite hobbies include running, camping, 
and exploring new places.
